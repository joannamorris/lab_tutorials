1. Scalp topography: shows what effect the independent component process has on each electrode [ Green = no effect ; red = positive contribution ; blue = negative deflection]
2. Dipole Model Plot: shows estimated location of the source of the component ; shows estimated locations of brain equivalent dipoles (ECD)
3. Residual Variance and Dipole moment ratio: RV shows how much variance in the scalp topography is left over after subtracting the projected topography of the model equivalent current dipole from the IC scalp topography ; 2 dipoles will almost always provide a lower RV than one dipole
4. ERP image: shows all the activity of the independent component process across the entire dataset
5. Component Time series: shows a segment of activity from the component - useful for artifact detection such as eye blinks
6. Activity Power Spectrum: Shows the components distributions of power across frequencies
7. Independent Component number and Percent data variance accounted for: percent data variance accounted for shows how much of the original variance in the channel data can be attributed to this component - component number is the rank of this component after being sorted by the PVAF : the larger the component number and the less power the component accounts for, the less likely that the component is meaningful

**Telling Components Apart:**
1. Brain Component

![Brain component Image](/Images/brain_component2_img)

Brain components are the data we want to save. Brain components usually have scalp topographies that look dipolar, RV usually below 15%, power spectrum decreases as frequency increases, power spectrum usually has peaks between 5 and 30Hz (oftentimes at 10Hz - alpha), and epoched data will usually have a visible ERP

2. Ocular/Eye Components

![Ocular artifact image](Images/ocular_component_img)

Eye/ ocular components show eye movement, which drastically distorts data. Eye components have scalp topographies that suggest equivalent current dipoles near the eyes, or in other words red and blue will be focused on the frontal lobes or near the eyes ; power concentrated at low frequencies usually below 5hz ; vertical eye movement components will contain blinks in the data ; horizontal eye movement components will look like step functions

3. Muscle components

![Muscle artifact image](Images/muscle_component_img)

Muscles components show muscle movement such as jaw clenching, smiling, etc. ; power concentrated in higher frequencies (20 hz and up) ; can still be dipolar but will be located outside of skull

4. Heart Components

![Heart artifact image](Images/heart_component_img)

heart components show electric potentials generated by the heart picked up by the eeg; has clear QRS complex in the data at about 1hz, near linear gradient in scalp topography (example in the scalp map in image above) ;  no peaks in power spectrum ; and component time series may look like an ekg (heart monitor)

5. Line Noise

![line noise artifact image](Images/line_component_img)

In essence line noise is electrical current/signals that the eeg picks up from the electricity running through the walls, you can tell a component has line noise when there is a strong peak in power spectrum at either 50hz or 60hz as seen in the image above

6. Channel Noise

![channel noise image](Images/channel_component_img)

If an electrode has poor contact/connection to the scalp during recording then it may generate large artifacts - Independent Component Analysis (ICA) will separate this into their own component, Channel Noise. They have very focal scalp topography as seen in the image above in the scalp map. large and or consistent artifacts in the component activation, be cautious this may be confused with muscle components

7. Other components

![image of other components](Images/other_component_img)

Anything that doesn't fall into the components above may be classified as other. Has a higher IC number (>50  likely to be other) ; non-dipolar scalp maps (colors all over the place as shown in image above) ; spectrum can still have weak 10 hz peak as brain signals are likely mixed with other signals
